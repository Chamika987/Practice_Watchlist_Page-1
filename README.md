This is my **practice project — Watchlist Page** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It features a **flower shop–style product listing** with a **watchlist navigation link**, interactive **cards**, and buttons for **"Pay Now"** and **"Add to Cart"** actions.  
The project focuses on **responsive design**, **hover animations**, and **basic JavaScript interactivity**.

  - *Add Cart*: updates text to *Visit Your Cart*, changes style, and disables the button
